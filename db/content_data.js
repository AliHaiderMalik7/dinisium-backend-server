    tagline : `The Dinisium Ecosystem is a fully customizable platform to issueand manage digital assets designed for Banks, Asset Managers and Issuers`,
    about: `The name Dinisium is a simplified spelling of the Latin name for
    asset: Dignissim This name was adopted to communicate our vision that every 
    Token on this blockchain would be backed by an asset.
   
   The platform allows for the creation of Stablecoins as well as digital 
   representation of existing assets and securities on a Blockchain. 
   The platform is Blockchain agnostic meaning it can use any underlying 
   blockchain that best fits the requirements of the particular use case. 
   Currently the Dinisium platform is using Ethereum as the underlying 
   blockchain technology but can be customized to use Corda, Hyperledger,
   Quorum or any other Blockchain as required.`,
